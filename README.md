This repository contains codes and information of an IOT device such can communicate with other devices via various types of communication protocols.
 
Basically this device has IR + Bluetooth + WiFi + LoRa functionalities.
I used Raspberry Pi 0 W as a development board, it has built in WiFi and Bluetooth. And interface IR and LoRa module with it.
At the other side, I have used LoRa ESP32 OLED display module. Both devices are capable to work as transceiver module independently. 
0.96" OLED is used at both sides for displaying necessary data.
